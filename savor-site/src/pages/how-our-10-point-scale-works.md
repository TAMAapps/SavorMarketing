## Introduction
Ask ten diners to rate a bowl of tonkotsu ramen and you will get ten different answers. Some chase collagen rich broth, others obsess over noodle texture. A few judge only the chashu. When Savor set out to build dish level ratings we knew the system had to absorb those nuances yet still roll up into a single, easily understood score. Over a decade, thousands of tasting discussions and plenty of late night spreadsheet debates, the **Savor 10 Point Scale** emerged. This piece explains how it works, why we chose each criterion and what safeguards keep the numbers honest.

> Reader promise: by the end you will know exactly what a 7.4 means, why a 9 is rare and how the score adjusts as new reviews land.

## 1  Why Not Stick With Five Stars?
A five star system sounds simple, but in practice it collapses quickly. Most users avoid ratings below three, which bunches everything at the top. The gap between a very good dish and a life changing one becomes a rounding error. Chefs lose the incentive to chase marginal gains because the scoreboard cannot show them. We needed more headroom, so we doubled the resolution.

## 2  The Ten Criteria
We did not pull numbers from thin air. Each point maps to a specific sensory or value question. During testing we asked trained tasters to score dishes across dozens of dimensions. The winners became our rubric.

| Point | Criterion | Weight | Field Note Example |
|------:|-----------|-------:|--------------------|
| 1 | First bite impact | 15 % | The immediate pop of lime leaf in a Bangkok fried chicken |
| 2 | Ingredient quality | 12 % | Bright yolk in a Tokyo tamago kake gohan |
| 3 | Technique execution | 12 % | Perfect medium rare centre in a Lisbon sardine fillet |
| 4 | Authenticity | 10 % | Bun bo Hue that respects proper lemongrass heat |
| 5 | Creativity | 8 % | Kimchi brine in a Nashville hot wing |
| 6 | Presentation | 8 % | Clean line of sauce that signals balance, not showboating |
| 7 | Portion value | 8 % | Twelve plump dumplings for the price of eight in Shanghai |
| 8 | Consistency | 8 % | Third visit, same char on the yakitori |
| 9 | Aroma and finish | 7 % | Juniper smoke that lingers after a Copenhagen venison course |
| 10 | Crave again factor | 12 % | The itch to reorder tacos al pastor before leaving the stand |

### How a Review Becomes a Score
1. User snaps a photo. Computer vision guesses the dish so less typing is needed.  
2. Slider input captures the reviewer’s overall number.  
3. The app saves raw inputs, not just the final average.  

## 3  Reading the Numbers in Practice
• **Below 5** – The kitchen missed a fundamental, maybe under seasoning or soggy crust. Proceed only if you are curious about what went wrong.

• **6 to 7** – Solid everyday eating. Good for a quick lunch but not worth a detour.

• **7 to 8.5** – Memorable. The dish nails its brief and shows care in sourcing.

• **Above 8.5** – Plan a trip. These are the plates people text friends about before the bill even lands. Less than three percent of dishes reach this tier.

## 4  Frequently Asked Questions
**Does the scale punish inexpensive street food?** Absolutely not. It's all about taste and your personal experience. Price should be a factor in your rating but how much is up to you.

**Can a dish lose points over time?** Yes. Consistency is its own criterion.

**Why no half points?** The slider allows decimals.

## Conclusion
Numbers alone never capture the full pleasure of eating, but they steer us toward better bites. The Savor 10 Point Scale mixes data science with real world tasting discipline so that when you see an 8.3 next to a plate of Thai fried chicken you know it earned every fraction. Open the app, rate your next meal and help make the numbers even smarter.
