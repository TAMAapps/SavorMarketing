# @savortheapp X/Twitter Content Calendar (8-14 July 2025)

**Core Strategy:** High-frequency posting (4x daily) to build pre-launch momentum. Each tweet must feel like an authentic, stream-of-consciousness thought from the founder. The goal is to maximize visibility and create a constant conversation around food, memory, and the problems Savor solves. All tweets are lowercase, with no hyphens or semicolons.

| Day & Date | Time Slot | Tweet Content | Theme / Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tues 8 Jul** | Morning | just spent an hour arguing with a developer about the exact shade of gold for the rating stars. he thinks it's a button i think it's the key to the entire universe. is this normal. | Founder's Journey / Relatability |
| | Mid-day | my camera roll is 90% food 10% my dog. i regret nothing. | Foodie Love / Relatability |
| | Afternoon | is it weird that i trust a blurry photo of a friend's dinner more than a 1000 word blog post with perfect lighting? the blurry photo has *proof of life*. | Industry Rant / Core Philosophy |
| | Evening | just got the first piece of user feedback that wasn't from my mom. framed it. | Founder's Journey / Humor |
| **Weds 9 Jul**| Morning | woke up thinking about that one perfect slice of pizza i had in naples. i'd trade my entire camera roll for a search bar for my taste buds right now. | Problem Agitation / Foodie Love |
| | Mid-day | every online recipe: "a simple 10 minute recipe". step 1: julienne 14 vegetables you've never heard of and find the eye of a newt. | Industry Rant / Humor |
| | Afternoon | hot take: a restaurant's rating should decay over time. that 5 star review from 2019 is meaningless. the chef left the menu changed the lighting sucks now. we need to know what it's like *now*. | Industry Rant / Thought Leadership |
| | Evening | Poll: what's more important in a food photo? A) perfect lighting B) accuracy (this is what it *really* looked like) | Engaging Question |
| **Thurs 10 Jul**| Morning | someone asked me if savor is just for fancy food and i almost short circuited. my highest rated dish is a 9.7 for a gas station meat pie i had at 3am in the rain. it's about the memory not the price tag. | Core Philosophy / Myth Busting |
| | Mid-day | just found a bug where if you rate a dish 10/10 the button just plays the hallelujah chorus. honestly i'm calling it a feature. | Founder's Journey / Humor |
| | Afternoon | the star rating system is broken. a 3 for a michelin restaurant is a disaster. a 3 for a taco truck could mean it's the best thing you've ever eaten. context is everything. | Industry Rant / Problem Agitation |
| | Evening | what's the most overrated food? go. | Engaging Question |
| **Fri 11 Jul** | Morning | that little dopamine hit when you perfectly capture a dish before anyone touches it. the steam is still steaming. the sauce is glistening. a fleeting masterpiece. my camera roll is a museum of these moments. | Foodie Love / Relatability |
| | Mid-day | that friday feeling when you know you're about to add some new entries to your private food vault this weekend. | Foodie Love / App Tease |
| | Afternoon | someone just DMed asking for my top 5 pastas in london. give me a sec... *opens savor, filters 'pasta', sorts by rating, shares list*. okay done. this is literally why i'm building this thing. | App Utility / Founder's Journey |
| | Evening | i think i've finalized the onboarding flow. it's like a little story about why i had to build this. hope it connects with people. so nerve wracking. | Founder's Journey / Vulnerability |
| **Sat 12 Jul** | Morning | if you could only eat at one restaurant for the rest of your life which one would it be and why is it that one place you went to once on vacation five years ago that you can't remember the name of | Engaging Question / Problem Agitation |
| | Mid-day | i need a focus group. should the "add new dish" button be a fork or a plus sign. my entire weekend hangs on this decision. | Founder's Journey / Engaging Question |
| | Afternoon | the amount of code i've written fueled by instant noodles should be illegal. but also kinda poetic. building a food app on a diet of pure survival food. | Founder's Journey / Humor |
| | Evening | how do you currently remember a great dish? a) chaos camera roll b) finsta c) notes app d) just... forget it? | Engaging Question / Market Research |
| **Sun 13 Jul**| Morning | unpopular opinion maybe but i don't want AI to tell me what to eat. i want it to remember what i *loved* eating. there's a difference. | Core Philosophy / Tech Commentary |
| | Mid-day | scrolling food blogs for 'inspiration' and all i see are ads and popups. i just want to see the food. is that so much to ask. | Industry Rant |
| | Afternoon | thinking about all the amazing food moments lost to time. that first bite of a perfect croissant. the first time you tried real ramen. you can't get those back but you can save the next one. savorit. | Sentimental / App Link |
| | Evening | what's the best meal you've ever had? not the fanciest. the *best*. the one that's a whole story. | Engaging Question |
| **Mon 14 Jul**| Morning | the final countdown. checking off the last few bugs. every line of code feels like a prayer. please work. please don't crash. please help people find that burger they had that one time. | Launch Countdown / Founder's Journey |
| | Mid-day | just wrote the 'app is live' announcement tweet. stared at it for 10 minutes. deleted it. wrote it again. this is fine. everything is fine. | Founder's Journey / Vulnerability |
| | Afternoon | to everyone who's been following this journey thank you. you have no idea how much seeing a single 'like' on a 2am thought has meant. almost there. | Community / Gratitude |
| | Evening | launch day is so close i can taste it. and it tastes like cold coffee and pure adrenaline. what a ride. hopefully what we've built helps you remember all the best things you've ever tasted. http://savortheapp.com | Founder's Journey / Call to Action |
