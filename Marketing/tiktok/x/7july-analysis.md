## Content Analysis & Observations

The existing tweet style is already very strong and aligns well with the requested persona.

*   **Founder's Voice:** The stream-of-consciousness, lowercase, and slightly vulnerable "building in public" style comes through clearly (e.g., "2 AM thought, what if nobody downloads it?"). This is the strongest element and should be amplified.
*   **Core Problem Focus:** The tweets effectively hammer home the core problems Savor solves: forgotten food memories, useless generic reviews, and disorganized food photos.
*   **Relatability:** The content is highly relatable for foodies (e.g., "scrolling through photos, texting friends, googling 'good pasta downtown'").
*   **Engagement:** Currently, engagement (likes, replies) is very low. This is expected pre-launch but indicates an opportunity to be more provocative or ask more direct questions to stimulate replies.
*   **Weaknesses:** Some tweets from early June are more generic news-sharing ("Daniel Motlop...", "official rankings check..."). The feed is much stronger when it's personal and focused on the founder's journey and the app's core value proposition.

The strategy should be to double down on the successful personal/ranting style while introducing more direct questions and slightly more controversial takes to spark conversation.
