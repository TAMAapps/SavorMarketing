Savor Core Context

## App Identity

**Tagline:** "Real Foodies Keep Score"

**One-Sentence Description:** 
Savor is your personal food memory vault that lets you capture, rate, and compare every dish you've ever loved—turning fleeting food moments into a searchable, shareable taste autobiography.

**Elevator Pitch:**
Remember that perfect pasta from three years ago? That life-changing ramen in Tokyo? Savor transforms your dining experiences into a personal food journey you'll never forget. Snap, rate, and save every dish to build your private taste database—then unlock the power to compare today's chicken tikka against every one you've ever rated, create city-specific "best of" lists, and share your most trusted recommendations with friends. While others rely on strangers' reviews, you'll have your own curated food memoir at your fingertips, making every meal a chapter in your culinary story.

## Core Problem & Solution

**Problems Solved:**
1. **The Forgotten Feast Syndrome**: We forget 90% of our dining experiences, including life's best moments
2. **The Comparison Trap**: Can't objectively compare dishes across time and places
3. **The Trust Gap**: Relying on random reviewers who don't share your taste
4. **The Recommendation Scramble**: Friends ask for recs but you can't remember specifics

**The Savor Solution:**
Private food diary + objective scoring system + instant list creation = Never lose a food memory again
