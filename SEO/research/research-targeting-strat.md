- “How to remember what you ate at [restaurant/city/event]”
- “Track every dish I eat app”
- “App to rate food at restaurants”
- “How to organize food experiences”
- “Share my favorite dishes with friends app”
- “Create food lists app”
- “Compare my food experiences app”
- “Private food journal app”
- “Food journal not social media”
- **“Share custom restaurant lists with friends”**
- **“Best pasta dishes in London list to share”**
- **“Best pizza places I ate in 2024 to share”**
- **“How to make a custom food list for a friend’s request”**

## 4. Competitive Gap Analysis

- Most “food tracker” keywords are dominated by calorie counters and diet apps (MyFitnessPal, LoseIt, etc.), but very few focus on taste, dish rating, or food list sharing.
- “Food rating app” and “dish rating app” have low competition and are not well-served by major players.
- “Share food lists” and “custom restaurant list” are almost entirely untapped.
- **Focusing on list sharing and custom recommendations avoids direct competition with diary/diet apps and targets a more social, discovery-driven audience.**
