Research Summary
Based on the keyword analysis (dated June 27, 2025) and prior competitor research, we’ve identified strategic opportunities to position Savor as the leading dish-rating web app. The analysis ensures content aligns with food critics and foodies, leveraging low-competition keywords and avoiding health-focused terms.
● Keyword Analysis Insights:
○ Food Diary App (8,100-12,000 searches, KD: 75): Highly competitive, dominated by health apps (e.g., MyFitnessPal). Reposition as a culinary diary for taste-focused foodies.
○ Restaurant Review App (4,400-6,600 searches, KD: 85): Saturated by platforms like Yelp. Focus on dish-specific reviews to differentiate.
○ Foodie App (2,100-3,800 searches, KD: 45): Moderate competition, ideal for targeting food enthusiasts seeking culinary exploration.
○ Dish Rating App (480-920 searches, KD: 25): Blue ocean opportunity, perfectly aligned with Savor’s dish-rating core.
○ Personal Food Journal (1,800-2,900 searches, KD: 55): Suitable if framed as taste memory journaling, avoiding health tracking.
○ Long-Tail Opportunities: Keywords like “dish review app” (240 searches), “food memory app” (390 searches), and “foodie app for restaurant discoveries” (low competition) offer niche ranking potential.
● Competitor Landscape:
○ FreeScience.info: Strong on regional food identity but lacks interactivity or dish-specific focus.
○ SuperCook: Excels in recipe generation but misses cultural depth and dish ratings.
○ Diffen: Generic food comparisons, not dish-specific or culturally rich.
○ TheKitchn: Engaging recipe reviews but limited to recipes, not global dish experiences.
○ NumberAnalytics: Researched cultural context but lacks engagement tools.
○ Key Gap: No competitor dominates dish-specific rating or foodie-focused content, providing a clear path for Savor.
● Initial Efforts and Validation:
○ Pilot content targeting “foodie app” and “dish rating app” showed strong engagement on Instagram, where foodie content drives 60% higher interaction among 18-29-year-olds (per NC State Extension).
○ Long-tail keywords (e.g., “how to rate food like a critic”) achieved top 20 rankings in 4 weeks during prior tests, confirming rapid SEO potential.
○ Competitor weaknesses (e.g., lack of interactivity, generic content) highlight Savor’s opportunity to lead with user-driven ratings and dish-specific focus.
● Strategic Takeaways:
○ Prioritize “foodie app” and “dish rating app” for low competition and alignment with Savor’s mission.
○ Reposition “food diary app” and “personal food journal” as taste-focused to avoid health app overlap.
○ Use “restaurant review app” for dish-specific reviews, not location-based competition.
○ Leverage AnswerThePublic questions (e.g., “how to rate food quality”) for long-form blog posts to capture niche intent.
Proposed Strategy
We will deliver a topical authority map with ~25 blog posts per cluster (125 URLs total) across the five specified clusters: Food Diary App, Restaurant Review App, Foodie App, Dish Rating App, and Personal Food Journal. Content will be tailored to food critics and foodies, focusing on dish ratings and organization, and optimized for low-competition keywords to maximize SEO impact. The service includes content writing for blog posts, a content sheet with
outlines, schema markup, and metadata optimization using Rank Math, with technical guidance for setup. Remember that you must provide the headless WordPress CMS platform up and running.
Cluster Focus and Alignment:
1. Food Diary App: Repositioned as a culinary diary for logging taste experiences (e.g., blogging about a sushi tasting journey), targeting “food memory app” to avoid health connotations.
2. Restaurant Review App: Focused on dish-specific reviews within restaurants (e.g., blogging about rating tacos at local spots), targeting “dish review app” to differentiate from broad platforms.
3. Foodie App: Emphasizes culinary exploration (e.g., blogging about top dishes foodies love in NYC), targeting “foodie app” and “foodie app for restaurant discoveries.”
4. Dish Rating App: Core cluster, focusing on expert and user-driven ratings (e.g., blogging about rating ramen like a food critic), targeting “dish rating app” and “food rating app.”
5. Personal Food Journal: Framed as taste memory journaling (e.g., blogging about documenting paella adventures), targeting “personal food journal” and “food memory app.”
Deliverables:
● Content Sheet: Detailed sheet with 125 URLs (~25 per cluster), including:
○ Post titles aligned with AnswerThePublic questions and keyword analysis.
○ Primary and secondary keywords (e.g., “dish rating app,” “how to rate food like a critic”).
○ Content format (blogs: 800-1,500 words).
○ CTAs linking to app features (e.g., “Rate this dish in Savor”).
○ Outlines for each URL, submitted for client approval before writing.
● Content Writing: 125 blog posts in plain text format, delivered within 10 days of outline approval.
○ Blogs: Long-form (800-1,500 words) answering user questions (e.g., “how to rate food quality”).
● Schema Markup and Metadata:
○ Schema for homepage (WebSite), category pages (CollectionPage), blog posts (Article), rate page (WebApplication), my dishes page (WebPage), and community page (WebPage with InteractionCounter).
○ Metadata optimized with Rank Math for each URL (title, description, keywords).
● Technical Guidance:
○ Instructions for Rank Math setup in headless WordPress CMS.
○ Guidance on XML sitemap configuration, including fixed pages:
■ Homepage: /
■ Category Pages: /food-diary, /restaurant-reviews, /foodie, /dish-rating, /personal-food-journal
■ Rate Dishes: /rate
■ My Dishes: /my-dishes
■ Community: /community
○ Recommendations for sitemap submission to Google Search Console and crawl budget optimization.
● Process:
○ Submit content sheet with outlines for client approval.
○ Write content within 10 days post-approval.
○ Allow two rounds of adjustments post-delivery based on client feedback.
● Exclusions:
○ CMS uploading (client responsibility).
○ CMS platform setup (client must provide headless WordPress).
○ Video content creation (not requested by client).
Evaluation of Client’s Ideas:
1. Buying Expired Domains:
○ Recommendation: Support with caution.
○ Rationale: High-DA domains (DA > 20) with foodie-related backlinks can boost rankings for “foodie app” and “dish rating app.” Risks include spammy or health-focused domains misaligning with Savor’s audience.
○ Action: Identify domains with food blog/recipe backlinks using Ahrefs/Moz; set up 301 redirects to category pages (e.g., /dish-rating).
2. Long-Form Content from AnswerThePublic:
○ Recommendation: Strongly support.
○ Rationale: Questions like “how to rate food like a critic” align with foodie intent and low-competition keywords, per the analysis, driving rapid SEO gains.
○ Action: Source 10-15 questions per cluster for long-form blog posts, optimized for “People Also Ask” snippets.
Testing and Iteration:
● Timeline: 8-12 weeks post-content deployment to assess performance.
● KPIs:
○ Top 10 ranking for “dish rating app”; top 20 for “foodie app.”
○ 1,000+ organic visits from target keywords.
○ High engagement (3+ minutes dwell time; 2+ pages per session).
○ 100+ dish ratings or sign-ups via the web app.
● Next Steps: Scale high-performing clusters or pivot based on data.
Investment
● Total Cost: $1,500 (flat fee).
● Scope:
○ Content sheet with 125 URLs and outlines.
○ 125 blog posts (800-1,500 words) in plain text.
○ Schema markup and metadata optimization for each URL using Rank Math.
○ Technical guidance and setup for Rank Math and XML sitemap setup with schemas.
○ Two rounds of adjustments post-delivery.
