## Overview

This alternative onboarding flow emphasizes personal connection through founder storytelling while maintaining sophisticated psychological triggers suitable for food professionals, critics, and serious enthusiasts.

Three months after the most incredible ramen of my life in Tokyo, I couldn't remember the restaurant's name. As someone who lives and breathes food culture, this was devastating.
