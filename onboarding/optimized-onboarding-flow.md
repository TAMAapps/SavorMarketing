## Screen 1: Personal Hello from Alex
*Psychological Trigger: Trust Building + Founder Vulnerability + USP Introduction*

### Main Headline
**"Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹"**

### Subheading
**"I built Savor because I was tired of forgetting incredible dishes"**

### Supporting Copy
Last week I had the most perfect ramen in Tokyo. Three months later, I couldn't remember if it was better than the incredible ramen I had in Osaka three years ago. 

**I realized the problem wasn't just forgetting restaurants - it was forgetting the specific dishes that made them special.**

That's why I created Savor. It's the only app that lets you rate and compare individual dishes across time. Now I can instantly see how today's ramen stacks up against every bowl I've ever had.

**No more wondering "was this better than last time?" - now I know.**

### Call-to-Action Button
**"I need this too" â†’**

### Visual Elements
- Stylized founder avatar (professional yet approachable female)
- Split comparison: Ramen bowl today (8.7/10) vs Ramen bowl 2021 (7.2/10)
- Subtle background with Japanese food photography
- Personal signature: "- Alex" in handwritten style
- Floating comparison bubbles showing dish ratings over time
- Progress indicator: 1/8 screens

### Behavioral Psychology Notes

### Subheading
**"How many incredible dishes have already slipped away from your memory forever?"**

### Supporting Copy
You've spent thousands on unforgettable food experiences... but can you actually remember them? That life-changing pasta in Rome, the perfect ramen in Tokyo, the hidden gem your friend recommended last month.

**They're all fading away.**

And even worse - you can't compare them. Was today's burger better than the one you loved six months ago? You'll never know.

Every forgotten dish is money down the drain. Worse, it's a story you can't tell, a recommendation you can't make, a comparison you can't draw.
